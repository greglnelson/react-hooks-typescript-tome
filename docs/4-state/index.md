[&laquo; Return to the Table of Contents](../index.md)

Things get a lot more interesting in this chapter, when we start learning how to make actual applications with real state.

First we learn about the model React uses to manage State, and the basics of Hooks.

Then we learn about how to manage State across Components.

In the third section, we're briefly go over Firebase and how to set up a testing enviornment for it.

Finally, we learn about how to make cool user interfaces with Forms that manipulate state.
